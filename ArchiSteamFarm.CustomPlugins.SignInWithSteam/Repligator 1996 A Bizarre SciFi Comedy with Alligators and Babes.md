The plot of Repligator is simple: a group of scientists working for the army invent a device that can transport people across distances, but it has a side effect: it turns them into reptilian creatures called repligators. The repligators are hungry, violent, and horny, and they start attacking the army base and the nearby town. However, there is another twist: when the repligators mate with humans, they turn back into their original forms, but with a gender swap. This leads to hilarious situations involving cross-dressing, seduction, and confusion.
 
Repligator is not a movie to be taken seriously. It is full of bad acting, cheap effects, corny jokes, and gratuitous nudity. The movie does not shy away from its exploitation roots, and it embraces its campy nature. The movie is also full of references and homages to other sci-fi and horror movies, such as The Fly, The Thing, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and From Dusk Till Dawn. Repligator is a movie that knows what it is and does not pretend to be anything else.

Be warned: this movie is not for everyone. It is offensive, ridiculous, and nonsensical. But if you are in the mood for some mindless fun and laughter, you might enjoy Repligator as a guilty pleasure.
  
Repligator has received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences, who have criticized its poor quality, lack of plot, bad acting, and offensive humor. The movie has a rating of 2.5 out of 10 on IMDb, and no score on Rotten Tomatoes. Some reviewers have called it "the worst movie ever made", "an inspiration to young filmmakers", and "a terrible waste of tape". However, some fans of cult cinema have found some enjoyment in Repligator's absurdity, campiness, and cheesiness. The movie has been compared to other low-budget sci-fi comedies, such as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Sharknado.
 
Repligator was made by Bret McCormick, a Texas-based filmmaker who has directed and produced several other low-budget movies, such as The Abomination, Ozone! Attack of the Redneck Mutants, and The Demon Lover. McCormick has said that he made Repligator as a spoof of the sci-fi genre, and that he was influenced by Roger Corman, Ed Wood, and Russ Meyer. He also said that he had to film additional scenes with Gunnar Hansen and Brinke Stevens to pad out the running time to 90 minutes. McCormick has expressed his surprise and amusement at the cult following that Repligator has gained over the years.
 
Repligator is a movie that is not for everyone. It is a movie that is so bad that it might be good, or so bad that it is just bad. It is a movie that defies logic, taste, and common sense. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cringe, or both. It is a movie that you will either love or hate. It is a movie that you will never forget. It is Repligator.
